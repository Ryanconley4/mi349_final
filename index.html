                <p>
                    I am an enthusiastic and highly motivated software engineering student who is fascinated by
                    technology and its ability to improve our lives. I understand the fundamentals of both front and
                    back end development and plan to leverage those abilities to solve everyday world problems. I excell when
                    I'm able to collaborate with others as I'm able to motivate and understand the skillset of others. I look
                    forward to learning all that I can about software developement and taking on more challenges!

                <h4 class="center">Data Compression</h4>
                <p>
                    Technology drives our world today. It is integrated into education, work, entertainment, and even our
                    social lives. With that being said, it is inevitable that a massive amount of data is created and utilized
                    every day. It is estimated that new data is produced in the quintillions each day, a figure that is difficult to
                    even wrap your head around. Therefore, it becomes increasingly important to be able to manage and analyze this information
                    effectively. Smart data management and analysis is important as it saves entities critical time and resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data compression goes hand in hand with managing big data. This can involve different types of processes such
                    as storing data in a space effective manner or developing methods to transfer data points between storage effectively.
                    When you consider that big data can be composed of millions and even billions of data points, data compression becomes
                    crucial to working with the data set as even a small increase in efficiency can have a massive effect on the
                    overall runtime.

                    Artificial intelligence is a trending topic in the world of technology because of its large untapped
                    potential. AI is currently being developed to comprehend and respond to human emotions, analyze data, and
                    even conduct transportation as seen by the autonomous bus that will be tested on Michigan State's campus this spring! 
                    With all of the exciting applications that artificial intelligence could be used for, I am excited to start learning
                    about it soon.

                    Web development and other forms of front end development are interesting to learn because they provide a 
                    visual medium for users to interact with your backend code. Websites can be used to provide a service to clients
                    or promote an organization's brand. I have really enjoyed web design so far; it has been a fun and rewarding experience.
